# super-bot-whatsapp
This is a Whatsapp client for [super-bot](https://github.com/gfaraj/super-bot). It works on top of the Whatsapp Web application. The API is not public, so any changes made by Whatsapp could disrupt it at any time. 

The client relays messages to the bot service and sends back the bot's replies. It picks up messages that start with the "!" character as commands for the bot. It also has a couple of client-specific commands like "!screenshot" which takes a screenshot of only the current chat and sends it there, and "!moment " which takes the screenshot and also issues a "!record [name]" command to save the screenshot. The client supports sending images and custom stickers.
